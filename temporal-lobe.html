His dedication is not just stated but demonstrated, and I aspire to embody that level of commitment. This digital drawing depicts a scene from The Tale of Princess Kaguya, one of my favorite Studio Ghibli films. Although not directed by Miyazaki, the film’s hand-painted watercolor animation, developed over eight years, shows a level of commitment to craft that I hope to bring to my own research.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZK2y9NAaNo')">
